# Prosody Annotation


In this repository, you can find an example output showcasing prosodic features annotated using the Automatic ToBI tool, developed by the Speech Lab at SNUC, for English, Tamil, and Hindi.
The example folder contains one hour of data, along with corresponding phoneme, syllable, word, intensity, break, and pitch segmented files.
However, it's important to note that this work is still in progress, indicating ongoing efforts to refine and improve the annotations and tools involved.
